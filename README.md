2.0 features:

This pull request significantly refactors the application to modernize its architecture and UI. It introduces Jetpack Compose for the UI layer, Hilt for dependency injection, and Room for data persistence. The existing Java code is converted to Kotlin, leveraging coroutines and flows for asynchronous operations. The changes aim to improve the app's maintainability, scalability, and performance.

Highlights:
Dependency Updates: Updates dependencies to newer versions, including ViewModel, LiveData, Compose, Hilt, Room, and Coil.
Compose Integration: Integrates Jetpack Compose for UI development, including necessary dependencies and build configurations.
Hilt Dependency Injection: Adds Hilt for dependency injection, including dependencies, compiler configuration, and Android application setup.
Kotlin Conversion: Converts DayAheadWidget.java and MainActivity.java to Kotlin, leveraging coroutines and flows.
Room Persistence: Introduces Room for local data persistence, including entities, DAOs, and database setup.
Repository Pattern: Implements a repository pattern for data access, including Weather, News, Calendar, FunFact, and UserPreferences.
UI Architecture: Refactors the UI architecture to use Jetpack Compose and StateFlow for managing UI state.
Widget Updates: Updates the widget to use Hilt and coroutines for asynchronous data loading

# The Loop: An Expressive Daily Briefing App

"The Loop" is a single-screen, mobile-first application designed for Android 16. Its primary function is to provide users with a clean, highly personalized, and visually engaging daily briefing. The app should be intuitive, fast, and delightful to use, adhering to the principles of Material 3 expressive design to create a unique and tailored experience for each user.

## Target Platform

*   **Android 16+**
*   Designed for mobile form factors (smartphones)
*   Must be fully responsive and optimized for a wide range of screen sizes and resolutions.

## Design and User Experience (UX)

*   **Aesthetic**: The app must be built using Material 3 Expressive Design principles. This means the UI should feel dynamic, comfortable, and personalized.
*   **Layout**: The home screen should be a single, scrollable vertical feed, with each feature presented as a distinct, beautifully designed card or container.
*   **Interactions**: Implement smooth transitions, haptic feedback, and subtle animations to enhance the user experience.

## Core Features

*   **"The Day Ahead" Card**: A high-level summary of the user's day.
*   **Weather Card**: Displays current weather conditions and forecast.
*   **Top 3 Headlines Card**: Delivers the most important news of the day.
*   **Calendar Card**: Shows the user's upcoming events.
*   **"Fun Fact" Card**: Adds a lighthearted, engaging element to the briefing.

## Technical Considerations

*   **APIs**: The app will require APIs for weather and news.
*   **Permissions**: The app will need to request calendar permissions from the user.
*   **Data Handling**: Implement proper data handling for loading, error states, and refreshing content.
*   **Offline Functionality**: Cache data for offline viewing.

## Building the Project

This is a standard Android Gradle project. To build and run the application, follow these steps:

1.  **Open with Android Studio:**
    *   Open Android Studio.
    *   Select "Open an Existing Project".
    *   Navigate to and select the root directory of this project.
2.  **Sync and Build:**
    *   Android Studio will automatically detect the `build.gradle` files and sync the project, downloading the required dependencies and the correct version of Gradle.
    *   Once the sync is complete, you can build the project by clicking the "Build" button (hammer icon) or run it on an emulator or a connected device by clicking the "Run" button (play icon).

**Note:** The Gradle wrapper (`gradlew` script) that is typically used for command-line builds is not present in this repository, as it is auto-generated by the IDE. Using Android Studio is the recommended method for building this project.
