Learning: The application contains interactive elements (e.g., icons) with touch targets smaller than the recommended 48dp, which can make them difficult to activate for users with motor impairments or large fingers.
Action: When identifying small interactive elements, increase their size to at least 48dp using padding or layout adjustments, ensuring the visual size remains appropriate while the hit area is accessible.
